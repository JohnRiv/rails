Upgrading to Rails 4.2
----------------------

If you're upgrading an existing application, it's a great idea to have good test
coverage before going in. You should also first upgrade to Rails 4.1 in case you
haven't and make sure your application still runs as expected before attempting
an update to Rails 4.2. A list of things to watch out for when upgrading is
available in the
[Upgrading Ruby on Rails](upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#upgrading-from-rails-4-1-to-rails-4-2)
guide.

for detailed changes.

Action Pack
-----------

Please refer to the
[Changelog](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4-2-stable/actionpack/CHANGELOG.md)
for detailed changes.

### Notable changes

* The `*_filter` family methods has been removed from the documentation. Their
  usage are discouraged in favor of the `*_action` family methods:

      after_filter          => after_action
      append_after_filter   => append_after_action
      append_around_filter  => append_around_action
      append_before_filter  => append_before_action
      around_filter         => around_action
      before_filter         => before_action
      prepend_after_filter  => prepend_after_action
      prepend_around_filter => prepend_around_action
      prepend_before_filter => prepend_before_action
      skip_after_filter     => skip_after_action
      skip_around_filter    => skip_around_action
      skip_before_filter    => skip_before_action
      skip_filter           => skip_action_callback

  If your application is depending on these methods, you should use the
  replacement `*_action` methods instead. These methods will be deprecated in
  the future and eventually removed from Rails.
